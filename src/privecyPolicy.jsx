These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.

                                For event and exhibition management
                                If you participate in one of our events as a speaker, sponsor, exhibitor or attendee, your personal information will be used in connection with the running of the event, to handle payments and recover debts. This includes our legitimate business interests in carrying out logistic, administrative and analytics activities, to ensure our events run smoothly and so that we can offer an improved experience for our customers.

                                We may also use your personal information to maintain databases that allow us to assess your qualities as a speaker or sponsor/exhibitor, promote events and encourage further engagement at our events, and to request references in certain circumstances.

                                Where we have your consent to do so, we may share your personal information with exhibitors at the event you are going to attend, so that they can contact you in advance and arrange to meet with you during the event.

                                In addition, photos and videos are taken at our events, which may feature attendees, speakers, sponsors or exhibitors. Where we have taken photos and videos at our events that feature you as an attendee, sponsor or exhibitor, to the extent permitted by applicable data protection laws, those photos and videos may be used for promotional purposes. Third parties may also take photographs at our events, for example to maintain a record of stands or exhibitors they have visited. We are not responsible for the collection or use of images taken by third parties.

                                Where events and exhibitions use badge scanning technology, your personal information will be used to identify you at certain access points, such as to access VIP areas, seminars, entry and exit in other areas of the event. This will provide certain location information. Badges cannot be read remotely.

                                The personal information obtained from badge scanning will be used for access control, security and analysing visitor traffic with a view to improving the event experience for visitors and others. We may also use de-identified image data taken from cameras and/or location data collected via a mobile phone app and Bluetooth beacons to analyse visitor traffic and/or to assess attendance at particular seminars or presentations. This data may be shared with the relevant exhibitors.

                                You can also allow your badge to be scanned by event exhibitors. When you do so your contact details will be shared with the relevant exhibitor and used in accordance with applicable data protection laws, the exhibitor’s privacy policy and any other notices or consents you are provided with or given at the event.

                                Where we are hosting and managing a virtual exhibition or event, Informa (and any third party platform provider acting on our behalf) will use your personal information provided during the registration process to host and manage this digital event; and also for analyzing visitor interactions and traffic with a view to improving the event experience for visitors and provide you with a personalized experience.

                                When you enter virtual spaces, zones or rooms such as an exhibition booth, your personal information may be shared with the sponsor and exhibitor to allow them to engage with you subject to the attendee privacy notice you may have been provided during the registration and login process.

                                For our Publishing Services
                                If you publish work with us, your personal information, including the personal information of any named representative or beneficiary, is used in connection with the dissemination and promotion of your published work, and fulfilment of any contractual obligations, as is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests as a commercial organisation. Your name and affiliation will be published as part of authored work. Personal information is also used to handle payments or for other purposes, as is necessary to perform the contract entered into with us.
                                <br />
                                In addition, we sometimes take photos and videos at events associated with your published work. Where photos and videos are taken at our events that feature you as an author, we may use those photos and videos for promotional purposes.

                                For marketing
                                We may use your personal information to send you newsletters, offers or other marketing emails that keep you up to date with our news, events and products that may be of interest. Depending on the nature of your interaction with us and applicable data protection laws, you may have actively given us your consent (i.e. opted in) or we may be entitled to rely on your implied consent or legitimate interests to market to you. The opportunity to opt out of future marketing will always be provided, and you have the right to amend your marketing preferences at any time (see Your Rights section).
                                <br />
                                In some circumstances, where we have a lawful basis and you have provided your mobile telephone number, we may send marketing SMS/text messages or call you for marketing purposes, in accordance with applicable local laws. We may also send postal mailings with information on new products and events, where we have a lawful basis to do so and you have provided us with your postal address.

                                Many of our events and products are co-branded or sponsored by third party exhibitors or sponsors. We may share your details with these third party partners. Where this happens, a clear notice will be provided, that gives the opportunity to opt out or opt in to such sharing as required by applicable data protection laws. The third party
